                        <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
                            <p>For me, someone that has been a dancer since I was three years old, I ate, sleep, and breathed dance. I started competing at the age of twelve. Competing came with a lot of pros and cons.
                                    You were part of a team that became your second family and you went to competitions competing against different studios that lasted a whole weekend. What people do not realize is the time commitment you have to make.
                                    I went from dancing two days a week for about two hours to five days a week for about fifteen hours. But, if that is your passion it is all worth it.

                        <h3>Styles of Dance</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are an endless number of different styles. All of them are very different while some go hand in hand and are similar in ways. 
                                For example, jazz and hip hop are different styles but have its similarites. This goes for ballet and lyrical as well.

                        <h3>About The Author</h3>
                        <p>I am currently a Junior at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology with a minor in Entrepreneurship.
                            Dance has always been a passion of mine every since I could remember. Sports such as soccer were never my thing until I found dance at three year old. When I got into senior year of 
                            high school I had a big decision to make. I could have either danced for my last year at my studio or I could have spent my last year with my family and friends.
                            Dance took up most of your free time and I would miss a lot of opportunites. For example, I would have had to miss my after prom senior year. After prom is where your
                            whole group of friends rent a house in the Poconos. That is a once in a lifetime thing that I knew I would have regretted missing so I decided to stop dancing junior year.
                            But, my dancing was not over. Just my outside studio, I was still captain of my high schools dance team.
