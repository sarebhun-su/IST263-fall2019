<h1>Sami Rebhun</h1>
    <p>I am currently a Junior. I am going abroad in the Spring to Florence. I am excited to be able to travel to all different cities. </p>
    <p>I am from Ocean Township NJ which is about four hours and fifteen minutes from SU. I have an older brother and sister. My brother went to SU as well. I live less then 10 minutes from the beach so I am always there in the summer with my friends. I am a big family person. I was a competitive dancer for most of my life up until college when I decided to stop.</p>

    <p>A lot of people are not sure where in NJ I am from. I am from the Jersey Shore. Once I say what beaches/towns I am near most people then know exactly where I am. Some beaches are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deal</li>
        <li>Long Branch</li>
        <li>Asbury</li>
    </ul>
