    <p>My name is Sami Rebhun. I am currently a Junior majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Web Design and a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am going abroad in the Spring to Florence. I am excited to be able to travel to all different cities. </p>
    <p>I am from Ocean Township NJ which is about four hours and fifteen minutes from SU. I have an older brother and sister. My brother went to SU as well. I live less then 10 minutes from the beach so I am always there in the summer with my friends. I am a big family person. I was a competitive dancer for most of my life up until college when I decided to stop.</p>
