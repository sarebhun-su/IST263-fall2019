    <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
    <p>For me, someone that has been a dancer since I was three years old, I ate, sleep, and breathed dance. I started competing at the age of twelve. Competing came with a lot of pros and cons.
        You were part of a team that became your second family and you went to competitions competing against different studios that lasted a whole weekend. What people do not realize is the time commitment you have to make.
        I went from dancing two days a week for about two hours to five days a week for about fifteen hours. But, if that is your passion it is all worth it.

    <h3>Styles of Dance</h3>
    <p>There are an endless number of different styles. All of them are very different while some go hand in hand and are similar in ways. 
        For example, jazz and hip hop are different styles but have its similarites. This goes for ballet and lyrical as well.
