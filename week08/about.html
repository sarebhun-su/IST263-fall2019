    <h3>About the styles</h3>
    <p> Ballet and lyrical are considered to be the "pretty" styles. It is almost always slow songs that you dance to.
        Ballet is the core of dance. That is where all of your technique comes from. The more ballet classes
        you take the more your technique will grow. Lyrical is not as technical but you usually dance to a slower song as well.
        A lot of times during these styles you tell a story through your movements. Most times they can be a little upsetting and you have to show that through your facial expressions.
        The best is when you are able to relate to a story you are portraying. The emotion will just flow out naturally.

    <h3>Why I never liked Ballet and only Lyrical...</h3>
    <p> Ballet was never my favorite style. I was not a big fan of the slow music and everything you had to do be so precise. I was always into the fast pace styles.
        I did not start lyrical until I got a little older. I fell in love with that style right away. It blew my mind because I thought that would just go right
        along with ballet on my list that I did not like. Yes lyrical is slow but not as slow as ballet. There was no way of getting out of ballet either since it was a requirement for me to take. After years went
        by and I changed dance studios I started to like ballet. Then it hit me...I only disliked ballet because of the instructor that taught it. I started loving to
        go to ballet class because of my new instructor.

        <h3>Lyrical</h3>
        <p>The picture below was a very special dance. I had the lead role in it and this photograph was taken at a competition. 
            This dance told a story that I was able to relate to. This photo has had a lot of meaning
            to my family. My mom had her first book published recently and she used that picture to be her cover.
