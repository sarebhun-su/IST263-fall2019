<p>I have danced since I was three years old and started competing at the age of eleven. I have all the knowledge from personal experiences to have my webpage all about different styles of dance. The different pages I will have will be jazz, lyrical, hip hop, and ballet. The images I can use can be personal pictures that I have from all different years of me dancing with the styles I have selected to talk about. </p>
