            <h3>About the styles</h3>
            <p> Ballet and lyrical are considered to be the "pretty" styles. It is almost always slow songs that you dance to.
                Ballet is the core of dance. That is where all of your technique comes from. The more ballet classes
                you take the more your technique will grow. You have to take every class seriously but ballet is one that you simply cannot fool around in.
                Lyrical is not as technical but you usually dance to a slower song as well. Lyrical will pick up the pace a little but still be slow.
                A lot of times during these styles you tell a story through your movements. Most times they can be a little upsetting and you have to show that through your facial expressions.
                The best is when you are able to relate to a story you are portraying from a personal experience. The emotion will just flow out naturally. Now a days you will
                find dance studios doing mostly lyrical pieces to compete so in that case it is very hard to go up against that style for the first place trophy.

                <h3>Why I never liked Ballet and only Lyrical...</h3>
                <p> Ballet was never my favorite style. I was not a big fan of the slow music and everything you had to do be so precise. Your legs, arms, and everything had to look
                    identical to everyone in the dance or else it would be very noticable if someone messed up. Since this was the case I was always into the fast pace styles.
                    I did not start lyrical until I got a little older. I fell in love with that style right away. It blew my mind because I thought that would just go right
                    along with ballet on my list that I did not like. Yes, lyrical is slow but not as slow as ballet. There was no way of getting out of ballet either since it was a requirement for me to take. After years went
                    by and I changed dance studios I started to like ballet. Then it hit me...I only disliked ballet because of the instructor that taught it. I started loving to
                    go to ballet class because of my new instructor. It affected me in a lot of ways though because I realized that I knew my technique was strong but it could
                    have been even stronger because it was only because of an instructor that made me want to either miss class or stare at the clock waiting for it to be over.

                <p>The picture below was a very special dance. I had the lead role in it and this photograph was taken at a competition. 
                    This dance told a story that I was able to relate to. This photo has had a lot of meaning to my family. My mom had her first book published recently and she used that picture to be her cover.
