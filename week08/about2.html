        <h3>Makeup/Hair/Accessories</h3>
        <p> These styles is where you can be creative. You are able to have cool hair styles as well as fun makeup other then your regular competition makeup and you
            will sometimes have accessories around your neck, arms, legs etc. During competitions you will notice that the judges will even comment on those things and 
            how they love it because it is different then what they normally see people wear. Not everyone on your team will be wearing the same outfit either. sometimes
            your teacher will want to switch it up and have your whole team in three different types of costumes. Costumes can have the same pattern but come in three different styles.
            The photo below is my first jazz dance that I competed in competitions with. Dance competitions are very nerve wracking but the best feeling is holding that first
            place trophy/award and knowing all your hard work paid off.

        <h3>Why are these styles my favorite?</h3>
        <p> While performing these two styles there is nothing you can do but have a smile on your face. Whatever mood you are in it will change instantly. These styles 
            are when you can let loose and be fun while interacting with your teammates. The music that you dance to can range from remixes of different songs to get you
            up and moving. People tend to find these two styles the most entertaining. When it comes to jazz and hip hop you are also the most out of breath when finishing
            the dance. The photo below is my first hiphop dance that I ever competed in a competition. It was also my first ever dance I competed onstage with.
            You would think that after nailing your first dance your nerves would subside but they don't. You get the same nerves everytime before hitting the stage.
